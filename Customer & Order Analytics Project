# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- 1. How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT
sum(Quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 8. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT 
    product,
    SUM(quantity) order_count
FROM FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphones%'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;


-- 9. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT
    SUM(f.quantity * price)/COUNT(c.acctnum) avg_per_account
FROM FebSales f
LEFT JOIN customers c
    ON f.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE length(f.orderID) = 6
AND f.orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 10. Find order ids from Georgia (GA) where the order has an average price greater than $1,000. Only find orders from dates beginning with ‘04/1’. Assume that the dates are stored in the MM/DD/YY HH:MM format.

SELECT
    orderID
FROM AprSales
WHERE orderdate LIKE '04/1%'
    AND location LIKE '%GA%'
    AND length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY orderID
HAVING AVG(price) > 1000;

-- 11. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT
    product,
    SUM(price*quantity) revenue
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
