# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

-- 1. Which artists have the most tracks in the Top 50, and what is the average popularity of their charting tracks?

SELECT
    artist_name,
    COUNT(*) as track_count,
    AVG(popularity) as avg_popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY track_count DESC, avg_popularity DESC;


-- 2. Do songs written in a Major key (mode = 1) achieve a higher average popularity and danceability compared to songs in a Minor key (mode = 0)?

SELECT
    CASE WHEN song_mode = 1 THEN 'Major' ELSE 'Minor' END as key_mode,
    AVG(popularity) as avg_popularity,
    AVG(danceability) as avg_danceability
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY song_mode
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC, avg_danceability DESC;


-- 3. If we categorize tracks into 'High' (>= 0.75), 'Medium' (0.5 to 0.74), and 'Low' (< 0.5) danceability, what is the count of tracks in each tier?

SELECT
    CASE 
        WHEN danceability >= 0.75 THEN 'High'
        WHEN danceability >= 0.50 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END as danceability_tier,
    COUNT(*) as track_count
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY
    CASE 
        WHEN danceability >= 0.75 THEN 'High'
        WHEN danceability >= 0.50 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
        END
ORDER BY track_count DESC;


-- 4. Which artists have strictly more than one track on the Top 50 chart, and what is their total combined track duration (in milliseconds)?

SELECT
    artist_name,
    COUNT(artist_name) as number_of_tracks,
    SUM(duration_ms) as total_time_ms
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(id)>1
ORDER BY total_time_ms DESC;


-- 5. What are the top 10 longest tracks on the chart, and what is their duration converted from milliseconds into a rough "minutes" estimate?

SELECT
    artist_name,
    track_name,
    duration_ms,
    ROUND((duration_ms / 60000.0),2) as duration_minutes
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_minutes DESC
LIMIT 10;


-- 6. If a track has an energy > 0.6 and valence > 0.6, label it 'Upbeat'. Otherwise, label it 'Other'. How many tracks fall into the 'Upbeat' category?

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN energy > 0.6 AND valence > 0.6  THEN 'Upbeat'
        ELSE 'Other'
        END as mood_category,
        COUNT(id) as track_count
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY
    CASE
    WHEN energy > 0.6 AND valence > 0.6  THEN 'Upbeat'
    ELSE 'Other'
    END;
